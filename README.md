My name is Saarang Srinivasan and I'm a senior at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I'm fascinated by problems and have a strong interest in machine learning and algorithms. 

I'm currently working on projects in the fields of program verification/synthesis and ML systems through my coursework at Purdue. I'm also researching the problem of repeated cake cutting in algorithmic game theory. 

I'm looking for full time or internship roles in software engineering from May 2025.
