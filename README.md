My name is Saarang Srinivasan and I'm a senior at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I'm fascinated by problems and have a strong interest in machine learning and algorithms. More specifically, I'm interested in designing efficient and scalable Systems for Machine Learning. More information is on my website [here](https://saarang123.github.io/).

In the past, I've explored the TinyGrad ML framework, and developed a Translation Validation framework for it (still in the works). This was based on existing works like Alive2/MLIR-tv and implemented using the Python Z3 SMT library.

I've developed optimizations for the TVM AutoScheduler by integrating it with a GNN cost model to predict the runtime of low level tensor programs. Repo/fork available [here](https://github.com/knightron0/tvm-gnn-costmodel). 

I'm looking for full time or internship roles in software engineering or machine learning from May 2025.
